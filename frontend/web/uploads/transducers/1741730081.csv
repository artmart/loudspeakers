Bring those old and worn-down Yamaha S115V Club Series speakers back to life with the GRS S115V-LF woofer. Designed to be an improvement of the original, these can be swapped in only a few minutes with a few basic tools.The GRS S115V replacement woofer has been designed to improve the performance of your Yamaha Club Series speakers by optimizing crossover summation of the original installed woofers. When the GRS S115V-LF-8 is paired with the GRS S115V-HF-16 compression driver, you can expect an improvement in off-axis response, perfect summing at the crossover point, and increased detail and clarity in the high-end providing performance where you expect it most.Response with original driversResponse with GRS replacement driversImproved PerformanceThis woofer shares all of the important design features of the original, such as a 3"" edge-wound voice coil wound on a Kapton former and an engineered cone profile for ultra smooth upper midrange response that bests the original. When installed in the original cabinet, the bass extension of the GRS S115V is preserved, showing the same LF performance as the original, but with increased intelligibility that you would expect from a PA speaker thanks to its ability to fill in the notch at 1800Hz.A solid cast frame and large ferrite motor structure bring everything together, allowing this woofer to hold up to the harshest environments of live audio. Combine all of these traits together and you get not only a great, inexpensive replacement, but a solid improvement over the original - all while maintaining the strength and durability that allows it to last for years to come.

This dedication is apparent in every product they produce: tweeters, midranges, woofers, and finished systems that serve the Hi-Fi, home theater, and car audio markets. Morel systems are today sold in more than 55 countries around the globe. Their products are made with exceptional care; each is assembled by hand and extensively tested, undergoing seven different quality assurance steps, to ensure only the highest standards are met.Morel Titanium Supreme Series The Titanium Supreme midrange drivers from Morel are the latest leap forward in design. Huge 3"" Hexatech™ aluminum underhung voice coils (that use hexagonal shaped wire for high sensitivity and power handling) are wound onto titanium bobbins for amazingly low energy storage, resulting in lightning quick transients for superior attack and decay transients. Qms is also raised, and allows for a wider range of enclosure options. A Hybrid™ neodymium/ferrite Coppersleeve motor imparts high BL onto the voice coil while the copper-sleeved pole piece further reduces inductance.Uniflow­™ Aluminum Diecast Chassis All of this wouldn't mean anything if the air swept by the driver got trapped in the motor or frame. Morel designed the Uniflow chassis to be as open and sonically transparent as possible. An over-sized vent on the pole piece, a frame-suspended spider, and exposed voice coil combine to virtually eliminate reflections and output-robbing power compression. The Uniflow chassis also allows for the use of an over-sized spider for complete control of the over-sized voice coil.The 6"" TSCM 634 midrange features a 4-ohm impedance, and a unique, carbon fiber-Rohacell® composite cone offers flat frequency response from 49 Hz to 8,000 Hz on-axis. Its large voice coil allows it to handle 10 ms peak power transients of up to 1,000 watts when used correctly.Note: Only recomended for use as a midrange. Not recomended for use as a woofer in 2-way designs."	https://www.parts-express.com/Morel-TSCM-634-Titanium-Supreme-Series-6-Midrange-4-Ohm-297-106	562	AS

Capable of high output low-frequency response with remarkably low distortion, the MX15-22 is built for use in compact enclosures making it perfect for both home and car audio sound systems. With 38 mm of peak-to-peak excursion capability (Klippel verified at 70% Bl) this driver is capable of moving serious amounts of air.Over 1-1/2"" of travel (3/4"" Xmax) is kept completely linear through the use of dual spiders that also limit distortion and rocking modes. ""Tall-boy"" rubber surrounds with integrated gaskets maintain driver surface area during extreme excursion moments. Thick, one-piece Nomex honeycomb-covered cones are covered with woven, heavy-duty glass fibers creating ultra-stiff cones that resist deformation. It's About More Than Just Looks Many budget subwoofer drivers look powerful, but just don't offer high performance.When designing the MX15-22, Dayton Audio did everything possible to keep the cost down without sacrificing performance or reliability. A large inverted dust cap completely covers the rigid pulp paper cone to create an extremely stiff layered diaphragm with a sleek and modern look. The narrow but tall custom tooled surround has been optimized to allow high excursion without reducing cone area to ensure maximum displacement with improved efficiency. In addition, the surround actually wraps around the rear side of the mounting flange for maximum gluing surface area to handle the stress of high excursion without issue. To keep the cone linear, the MX15-22 uses dual spiders with ample spacing to make sure there is no rocking even when driven to its limit.Extensive VentingHigh output subwoofers can generate a lot of heat, excess heat build-up increases temperature which in turn causes resistance to climb. This will lead to lower output, power compression, and premature failure.The MX15-22 has everything it takes to move as much air as possible across the 2-1/2"" voice coil to dissipate this excess heat. Six Large diameter vents in the cone combined with a flared pole piece vent create a continuous flow of air directly through the center of the voice coil. The outside of the coil is cooled by eight under spider vents in the frame and six peripheral gap vents through the back plate. All of this airflow makes sure that power compression is kept to a minimum, but it also gives the MX15-22 extremely quiet operation even at high excursion, nearly eliminating the mechanical noise that is all too common with many of today's subwoofer drivers.A Powerful MotorAnother common problem with many of today's budget subwoofer drivers is a lack of motor strength. This leads to drivers that are inefficient or are only capable of the ""one note"" bass that is the result of high Q drivers.The massive dual-stacked high-energy ferrite magnets have been optimized to drive the 2-1/2"" voice coil efficiently with accuracy and precision. Also, the magnetic gap has been kept narrow to guarantee that there is as little loss of magnetic force as possible. This powerful motor assembly gives the MX15-22 an impressive Bl of 20.6 T/m with a Qts of 0.46, making it suitable for use in compact sealed or vented enclosures with excellent low-frequency extension.Finally, with dual 2-ohm voice coils, the MX15-22 can be used in a number of configurations to make sure that you get maximum performance from your amplifier in almost any application. In most home audio designs the coils will be wired in series for a 4-ohm load. When used in car audio systems you have the option of running the coils separately for a dual 2-ohm load or wired in parallel at 1 ohm to get the most power out of today's high current amplifiers.Max Value to PerformanceThanks to extensive optimization and advanced design, the Dayton Audio MX15-22 is a low-cost high-performance subwoofer that truly delivers incredible output capability and low distortion from compact designs. The Max-X drivers the perfect choice for building a powerful home stereo speaker, high SPL mobile audio system, or a sound quality based car audio system without breaking the bank.Note: All specifications measured with the voice coils wired in series for a 4-ohm load.Feel Maximum Power On The Road Build by Quyen.The Max-X 15-22 15"" Subwoofer delivers more than enough power to rock the roadways.

Capable of high-output low-frequency response with remarkably low distortion, the MX10-22 is built for use in compact enclosures making it perfect for car audio sounds systems. With 27.4 mm of peak-to-peak excursion capability (Klippel verified at 70% Bl) this driver is capable of moving serious amounts of air. It's about more than just looksMany budget subwoofer drivers look powerful, but just don't offer high performance.When designing the MX10-22, Dayton Audio did everything possible to keep the cost down without sacrificing performance or reliability. A large inverted dust cap completely covers the rigid pulp paper cone to create an extremely stiff layered diaphragm with a sleek and modern look. The narrow but tall custom tooled surround has been optimized to allow high excursion without reducing cone area to ensure maximum displacement with improved efficiency. In addition, the surround actually wraps around to the rear side of the mounting flange for maximum gluing surface area to handle the stress of high excursion without issue. To keep the cone linear, the MX10-22 uses dual spiders with ample spacing to make sure there is no rocking even when driven to its limit. Extensive venting to keep everything coolHigh output subwoofers can generate a lot of heat, excess heat build-up increases temperature which in turn causes resistance to climb. This will lead to lower output, power compression, and premature failure.The MX10-22 has everything it takes to move as much air as possible across the 2-1/2"" voice coil to dissipate this excess heat. Six Large diameter vents in the cone combined with a flared pole piece vent creates a continuous flow of air directly through the center of the voice coil. The outside of the coil is cooled by eight under spider vents in the frame and six peripheral gap vents through the back plate. All of this airflow makes sure that power compression is kept to a minimum, but it also gives the MX10-22 extremely quiet operation even at high excursion, nearly eliminating the mechanical noise that is all to common with many of today's subwoofer drivers. A powerful motor for incredible flexibilityAnother common problem with many of today's budget subwoofer drivers is a lack of motor strength. This leads to drivers that are inefficient or are only capable of the ""one note"" bass that is the result of high Q drivers.The massive dual stacked high energy ferrite magnets have been optimized to drive the 2-1/2"" voice coil efficiently with accuracy and precision. Also, the magnetic gap has been kept narrow to guarantee that there is as little loss of magnetic force as possible. This powerful motor assembly gives the MX10-22 an impressive Bl of 18.2 T/m with a Qts of 0.46, making it suitable for use in compact sealed or vented enclosures with excellent low frequency extension.Finally, with dual 2 ohm voice coils, the MX10-22 can be used in a number of configurations to make sure that you get maximum performance from your amplifier in almost any application. In most home audio designs the coils will be wired in series for a 4 ohm load. When used in car audio systems you have the option of running the coils separately for a dual 2 ohm load, or wired in parallel at 1 ohm to get the most power out of today's high current amplifiers. Maximum value to performance ratioThanks to extensive optimization and advanced design, the Dayton Audio MX10-22 is a low-cost high-performance subwoofer that truly delivers incredible output capability and low distortion from compact designs. The Max-X drivers the perfect choice for building a powerful high-SPL mobile audio system, or a sound quality based car audio system without breaking the bank.Note: All specifications measured with the voice coils wired in series for a 4 ohm load.
